## Files Included
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the application, including responsiveness and print styles.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- No additional server or backend is required as everything is managed locally within the browser.

## Future Improvements
- **Export/Import**: Add functionality to export a canvas as a JSON or text file and import it to another browser.
- **Collaboration**: Integrate with online services to allow multiple users to collaborate on the same canvas.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Further improvements to ensure compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Known Issues
